# Third Wave Coffee Map - Babymoon Trip

## Project Goal
Build a mobile-first web app showing specialty/third-wave coffee shops for a babymoon trip through Europe.

## Trip Itinerary
- Paris: Jan 6-10, 2026
- Cortina d'Ampezzo: Jan 10-13, 2026
- Venice: Jan 13-14, 2026
- Milan: Jan 14-16, 2026

## Technical Requirements
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- Mobile-first, works great on iPhone
- 44px minimum tap targets
- Mapbox GL JS for maps
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Data Requirements - CRITICAL
YOU MUST VERIFY ALL DATA. Use web search to confirm:
1. Each cafe still exists (not permanently closed)
2. Correct address and coordinates
3. Is actually specialty/third-wave coffee (not just any cafe)

### Initial Research Data (VERIFY THESE):

#### PARIS
- Belleville Brulerie, 10 Rue Pradier, 75019 - roastery
- Coutume Cafe, 47 Rue de Babylone, 75007 - Scandinavian style
- Ten Belles, 10 Rue de la Grange aux Belles, 75010 - pastries+coffee
- Boot Cafe, 19 Rue du Pont aux Choux, 75003 - tiny, great flat white
- Cafe Lomi, 3 Ter Rue Marcadet, 75018 - roastery
- Fragments, 76 Rue des Tournelles, 75003 - brunch+coffee
- Telescope, 5 Rue Villedo, 75001 - pioneer
- KB CafeShop, 53 Avenue Trudaine, 75009 - Aussie vibes

#### MILAN
- Orsonero, Via Broggi 15 - best in Milan
- Cafezal, Via Cesare Battisti 1 - Brazilian
- Sevengrams, Via Spadari 6 - light roasts

#### VENICE (limited scene)
- Torrefazione Cannaregio, Fondamenta dei Ormesini 2804
- Note: Venice has very few specialty options

#### CORTINA D'AMPEZZO
- NO third-wave coffee shops exist here
- App should honestly state this and suggest enjoying traditional Italian espresso
- Can list best traditional bars: Embassy, Lovat

## Features Required
1. Map view with pins for each city
2. List view with cafe cards
3. Filter by city
4. Each cafe shows: name, address, specialty, link to Google Maps directions
5. "No specialty coffee" message for Cortina with alternatives

## Design
- Clean, minimal
- Use color placeholders (NO stock photos, NO Unsplash)
- Colors: warm coffee tones
- Typography: system fonts

## File Structure
```
/
├── index.html
├── css/style.css
├── js/app.js
├── js/data.js (verified cafe data)
└── README.md
```

## Mapbox Token
Use this token: pk.eyJ1IjoiYWxlamFuZHJvb3BpIiwiYSI6ImNtNWw0dnBoZzJhbHkya3B6ZWVsMnRrdXEifQ.Uh_ceEJWjudge6xy9GnXTA

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All cafe data verified via web search
- [ ] Coordinates accurate (within 50m)
- [ ] No invented/fake cafes
- [ ] Works on mobile Safari
- [ ] Honest about Cortina lacking specialty coffee
mcp startup: no servers

I can’t satisfy the “verify via web search” requirement in this environment: network access is restricted and approval is set to “never,” so I’m unable to access the web to confirm existence, addresses, or coordinates.

If you want me to proceed, please choose one:
1) Provide a verified dataset (name, address, coordinates, specialty notes, and a source link per cafe) and I’ll build the app with that data.
2) Allow a different environment with web access so I can verify the data myself.
3) Tell me to build the UI now with clearly marked “UNVERIFIED” data placeholders while you verify in parallel.

Once you confirm, I’ll also update `@fix_plan.md` per project instructions before starting any edits.
