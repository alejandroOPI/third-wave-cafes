I need comprehensive research on third-wave / specialty coffee shops for a babymoon trip in January 2026. This research must be EXHAUSTIVE and ORGANIZED BY NEIGHBORHOOD.

## DESTINATIONS & DATES:
1. **Paris, France** (Jan 6-10) - Organize by arrondissement (1st, 2nd, 3rd... 18th, 19th, 20th)
2. **Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy** (Jan 10-13) - Small town, list any specialty options
3. **Switzerland stops** - Research coffee in:
   - Zurich
   - Geneva
   - Lausanne
   - Bern
   - Basel
   - Lucerne
   - Any other major Swiss cities with specialty coffee scenes
4. **Venice, Italy** (Jan 13-14) - Organize by sestiere (San Marco, Dorsoduro, Cannaregio, etc.)
5. **Milan, Italy** (Jan 14-16) - Organize by neighborhood (Brera, Navigli, Porta Venezia, Isola, Centrale, Duomo, etc.)

## FOR EACH COFFEE SHOP PROVIDE:
- Name
- Full address
- Neighborhood/Arrondissement/Sestiere
- Coordinates (latitude, longitude) if possible
- Hours of operation
- Specialty (espresso, filter, cold brew, roastery, etc.)
- Instagram handle if known
- Any notes (closed certain days, reservation needed, etc.)

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus on TRUE third-wave/specialty coffee (not regular cafes)
- Include roasteries and flagship stores
- Note any that might be closed in January
- Be thorough - I want at least 5-10 options per major city
- For Paris, I expect 20+ cafes across arrondissements
- For Milan, I expect 10+ cafes across neighborhoods
- For Switzerland, research each city mentioned

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Organize as JSON with this structure:
{
  "paris": {
    "1st": [...],
    "2nd": [...],
    ...
  },
  "switzerland": {
    "zurich": [...],
    "geneva": [...],
    ...
  },
  "venice": {
    "dorsoduro": [...],
    ...
  },
  "milan": {
    "brera": [...],
    "navigli": [...],
    ...
  },
  "cortina": [...]
}

Take your time. Be thorough. Quality over speed.
